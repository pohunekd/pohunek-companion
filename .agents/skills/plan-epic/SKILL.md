description: >-
  Split a pohunek-companion epic, milestone, or oversized issue into small,
  ready issues with checkable DoD, linked as native sub-issues with
  dependencies, in the right milestone and the project. Use when an epic has no
  sub-issues yet, when a milestone needs its next issues, or when an issue is
  too large for one PR.

# plan-epic

1. Read the epic (body and comments), `docs/architecture.md`, and the current
   code it touches. Verify each candidate piece of work is not already done or
   filed (search open and closed issues).
2. Cut the scope into issues that each fit one PR (soft limit in
   `.github/agent-workflow.json`) and deliver something runnable on their own.
   Order them by dependency; prefer a thin end-to-end slice first over
   layer-by-layer work.
3. Write each issue per the github-workflow skill (Feature or Task template,
   stable D items, entry points, verification). Put open questions that only
   the owner can answer in a separate `needs-decision` issue with options and
   a recommendation, instead of guessing them into a DoD.
4. Create the issues in the epic's milestone, add them to the project as
   `Todo`, link each as a native sub-issue of the epic, and set native
   `blocked_by` dependencies. Read every link back.
5. Comment on the epic with the ordered list of sub-issues and the reasoning
   for the cut.

Do not plan beyond what the current architecture supports: work that depends
on an unreleased Pohunek feature is filed as `blocked` on the upstream issue
(link it by URL).
